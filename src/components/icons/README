These icons are from the npm package `vue-material-design-icons` that is a
wrapper for https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign.

The files are copied instead of using 

    import FooIcon from 'vue-material-design-icons/Foo.vue'

because the 6000+ icons are in one directory and that may result in the error

    ENOSPC: System limit for number of file watchers reached

on some systems.
